## 📈 Key Findings & Strategic Recommendations

### 1. 🏆 High-Performing Region

**Finding**
The **South Region** is the primary revenue driver, generating the highest Net Sales of **$95.8K**. This indicates strong customer demand and effective sales execution in the region.

**Recommendation**
- Allocate more marketing budget to the South through digital advertising and promotions.
- Increase inventory levels to reduce the risk of stockouts.
- Study successful sales practices in the South for possible application to other regions.

### 2. 💻 Top Product to Promote

**Finding**
**Laptops** generate the highest sales at **$174.6K**, significantly outperforming other products.

**Recommendation**
- Prioritize Laptops in major marketing campaigns.
- Maintain high inventory availability, particularly in the South Region.
- Use Laptops as a lead product to attract customers and encourage additional purchases.

### 3. 📦 Low-Performing Products — Lift Strategy

**Finding**
Products such as **Mouse, Keyboard and Monitor** generate comparatively lower sales.

**Recommendation**
- Bundle lower-performing products with high-performing products.
- Create packages such as **Laptop + Mouse** or complete **Laptop + Desk Setup** deals.
- Use targeted discounts selectively to increase demand for slow-moving products.

### 4. 👥 Sales Representative Coaching Opportunity

**Finding**
There is a clear variation in **Average Order Value (AOV)** across sales representatives. **Liam Jones** is the top performer with an AOV of approximately **$1.1K**, while other representatives range between approximately **$684** and **$368**.

**Recommendation**
- Analyze Liam Jones' sales approach, customer profile, and strongest-performing region.
- Use his approach as a benchmark for sales team training.
- Encourage the sales team to focus not only on the number of orders but also on increasing Average Order Value.

### 5. 💰 Discount Policy Review

**Finding**
The **East Region** has the highest discount amount at approximately **$5.9K**, yet it is not the top-performing region in sales. Approximately **6% of East Region sales** is given as discounts, suggesting that the current discount strategy may be reducing margins without generating proportional revenue growth.

**Recommendation**
- Shift toward targeted and performance-based discounts.
- Apply discounts strategically to slow-moving products rather than across-the-board.
- Avoid unnecessary heavy discounting in strong-performing regions such as the South, where customer demand is already strong.
- Monitor revenue generated per dollar of discount to measure discount effectiveness.

## 💡 Overall Business Takeaway

The analysis shows that **regional performance, product mix, sales representative effectiveness and discount strategy** have a significant impact on sales performance.

The business can improve revenue and profitability by **investing more in high-performing regions and products, replicating successful sales practices, improving cross-selling and applying discounts more strategically**.
